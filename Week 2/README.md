# Week 2 Deliverables

This folder contains all the work for Week 2 of the SOC lab.  
I’ve tried to keep things organized by task so it’s easier to follow.

## Folder Layout

- **Alert-Management**  
  Notes, scripts, and screenshots related to alert mapping and handling.  
  Example: Wazuh install script, dashboard captures.

- **Response-Documentation**  
  Templates and logs used during incident response.  
  Example: investigation notes, phishing checklist, post‑mortem draft.

- **Alert-Triage**  
  Evidence from triage activities.  
  Example: Wazuh alert screenshots, IOC validation notes.

- **Evidence-Preservation**  
  Files and records showing how evidence was collected and preserved.  
  Example: Velociraptor CSVs, memory dump hashes, chain‑of‑custody doc.

- **Capstone-Project**  
  Final project work.  
  Example: exploit screenshots, detection evidence, CrowdSec block, stakeholder briefing.

## Notes

- Some files are raw exports (CSV, tar.gz, zip) kept for authenticity.  
- Screenshots are full‑window where possible to show the actual dashboard.  
- Documentation is written in a simple style, not polished — the goal is clarity and reproducibility.
