Subject: Briefing – Week 2 SOC Lab Findings

This week’s analysis focused on simulated attack detection. Our monitoring tools flagged suspicious activity, which we confirmed through triage and evidence preservation. The incident was contained using CrowdSec, preventing further impact. Documentation and screenshots are included for transparency. The exercise demonstrates our ability to detect, respond, and communicate effectively. No real systems were harmed; this was a controlled lab scenario.
