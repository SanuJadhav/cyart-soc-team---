Subject: Escalation – Suspicious Wazuh Alert

Hi Team,

During triage I observed repeated Wazuh alerts tied to abnormal outbound traffic from host 10.0.2.15. Initial checks suggest possible data exfiltration. I’ve preserved logs and attached screenshots for review. Given the persistence and potential impact, I recommend immediate escalation to Tier‑2 for deeper investigation. Please advise on containment steps.

Regards,
Sanika
